print("Python is fun!")

#print("Hello World!")
#print("Have a good day.")
#print("Learning Python is fun!") #The statements are executed one by one, in the same order as they are written

#print("Hello"); print("How are you?"); print("Bye bye!") # You can write multiple statements on one line by separating them with ; but this is rarely used because it makes it hard to read

#print("Python is fun!") print("Really!") #However, if you put two statements on the same line without a separator (newline or ;), Python will give an error
